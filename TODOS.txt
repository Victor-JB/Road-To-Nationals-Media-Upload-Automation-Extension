High:
1. add easy athlete name / event / meet name inpout, not even have to rename videos
1. HAVE THE FOLDERS PERSIST, NOT A BAJILLION API CALLS TO DO SO
3. create example usage, so people know how it works
 - specifically for how the naming works, and how manahgers can either rename the videos or use the builtin forms to rename the videos
  - also explain how the matching works for the autofill
4. donation set up -- can donate
5. CREATE ONBOARDING PAGE THAT IS OPENED UPON INSTALL? Can do donation + demo of how it works


high priority:
1. implement queue for upload clicking; as in, the current upload doesn't get killed if person clicks button for next upload
2. MAKE SURE UPLOAD DOESN'T DIE IF user closes extension, some way of remembering upload progress
2.5 Also incliude a cancel button to cancel upload
3. PARELLEL UPLOADS--upload multiple videos at once for mass upload
4. better progress bar, with blobs so that video progress is tracked
Upload all of these safeguardand performance enhancers before releasing next version to puboic


1. add field for meet name, to not have person re copy pasting the name
2. add loading icon for refresh folders


1. drop down of team members who are added, so user doesn't have to reinput video name every time, can just 
put in initial template
2. streamlining process further, reducing number of fields user needs to input, standardize and save preferences
3. donate button "buy coffee" in extension and chrome web store
4. consider making larger

Later:
- CV to read score values off of score sheet

- consider reuahting inside of base functions, not doubling function count with reauth wrappers
- better error handling in general--making sure entire extension doesn't die over one error
- better message logging and video progress tracking for mass upload!! should be same as individual uploa
- ensure loading bar is actually accurate and updates per video when the videos are being loaded

- ensure the correct prod oauth client is being used for prod, the only one that is going to request google access
     - get oauth for this 

1. fix progress bar -- make it actually legit
3. better readme -- use nice template from the other guy
4. Use jquery to automatically populate fields youtube ids for road 2 nationals whilst logged into the site!
5. possibly ask road2nationals for api collaboration
6. more robust error handling -- always 
7. figure out distribution--getting it to more teams if it is useful
8. figure out how it works on mobile--if it looks nice, works well, can be done quickly upon
logging into the site, even from the meet

Critical:
- zip new package and upload to web store for verification
- add a link to the privacy policy in the extension
- verification for google oauth consent screen
- also make a field for the video name as well
- use jquery to populate youtube ID fields in road2nat automatically

MAKE A "HOW TO USE" doc for first time users, it redirects you to that site +
have the url in the extension itself; explain how you need to name videos accordingly,
what the extension does automatically, how to upload videos, etc.

Ok, recall earlier you said I could do dynamic uploading with blobs where you integrate the code to track the actual upload progress of the video file, with the blobs you mentioned? how would I implement this with the code now here
