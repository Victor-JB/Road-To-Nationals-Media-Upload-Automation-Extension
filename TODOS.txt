- change Workflow & Planning tag, that is not the extension...

- after videos are uploaded, save their ids to chrome local storage for when person goes to road to nationals

- ensure loading bar is actually accurate and updates per video when the videos are being loaded
- ensure the correct prod oauth client is being used for prod, the only one that is going to request google access
- implement queue for upload clicking; as in, the current upload doesn't get killed if person clicks button for next upload
- add description to the playlist... Total Team score is usually what will puts
- have the Uploading... section persist for longer, doesn't get killed

Critical:
- zip new package and upload to web store for verification
- add a link to the privacy policy in the extension
- verification for google oauth consent screen
- recursively go through all folders in a selected folder, find all the videos so
the folder structure doesn't need to be a certain way
- make fields to enter scores for all unique videos, is that the best way to do it?
     - possibly find better way to have scores uploaded
     - then make sure score gets put in description
- also make a field for the video name as well, or 
- use jquery to populate youtube ID fields in road2nat automatically

Non critical:
- take all content from google doc privacy policy and put in html version

MAKE A "HOW TO USE" doc for first time users, it redirects you to that site +
have the url in the extension itself; explain how you need to name videos accordingly,
what the extension does automatically, how to upload videos, etc.
