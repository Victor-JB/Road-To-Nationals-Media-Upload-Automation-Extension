Critical:
- zip new package and upload to web store for verification
- verification for google oauth consent screen
- recursively go through all folders in a selected folder, find all the videos so
the folder structure doesn't need to be a certain way
- make fields to enter scores for all unique videos, is that the best way to do it?
     - possibly find better way to have scores uploaded
     - then make sure score gets put in description
- use jquery to populate youtube ID fields in road2nat automatically

Non critical:
- take all content from google doc privacy policy and put in html version

MAKE A "HOW TO USE" doc for first time users, it redirects you to that site +
have the url in the extension itself; explain how you need to name videos accordingly,
what the extension does automatically, how to upload videos, etc.
