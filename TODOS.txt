- change Workflow & Planning tag, that is not the extension...

feature ideas:

high priority:
1. implement queue for upload clicking; as in, the current upload doesn't get killed if person clicks button for next upload
2. MAKE SURE UPLOAD DOESN'T DIE IF user closes extension, some way of remembering upload progress
2.5 Also incliude a cancel button to cancel upload
3. PARELLEL UPLOADS--upload multiple videos at once for mass upload
4. better progress bar, with blobs so that video progress is tracked
5. better ui, looks a little cleaner
Upload all of these safeguardand performance enhancers before releasing next version to puboic



1. drop down of team members who are added, so user doesn't have to reinput video name every time, can just 
put in initial template
2. streamlining process further, reducing number of fields user needs to input, standardize and save preferences
3. donate button "buy coffee" in extension and chrome web store
4. consider making larger
5
Later:
- CV to read score values off of score sheet

- consider reuahting inside of base functions, not doubling function count with reauth wrappers
- better error handling in general--making sure entire extension doesn't die over one error
- better message logging and video progress tracking for mass upload!! should be same as individual uploa
- ensure loading bar is actually accurate and updates per video when the videos are being loaded

- ensure the correct prod oauth client is being used for prod, the only one that is going to request google access
     - get oauth for this 

1. fix progress bar -- make it actually legit
3. better readme -- use nice template from the other guy
4. Use jquery to automatically populate fields youtube ids for road 2 nationals whilst logged into the site!
5. possibly ask road2nationals for api collaboration
6. more robust error handling
7. figure out distribution--getting it to more teams if it is useful
8. figure out how it works on mobile--if it looks nice, works well, can be done quickly upon
logging into the site, even from the meet

Critical:
- zip new package and upload to web store for verification
- add a link to the privacy policy in the extension
- verification for google oauth consent screen
- recursively go through all folders in a selected folder, find all the videos so
the folder structure doesn't need to be a certain way
- make fields to enter scores for all unique videos, is that the best way to do it?
     - possibly find better way to have scores uploaded
     - then make sure score gets put in description
- also make a field for the video name as well, or 
- use jquery to populate youtube ID fields in road2nat automatically

Non critical:
- take all content from google doc privacy policy and put in html version

MAKE A "HOW TO USE" doc for first time users, it redirects you to that site +
have the url in the extension itself; explain how you need to name videos accordingly,
what the extension does automatically, how to upload videos, etc.

Ok, recall earlier you said I could do dynamic uploading with blobs where you integrate the code to track the actual upload progress of the video file, with the blobs you mentioned? how would I implement this with the code now here
